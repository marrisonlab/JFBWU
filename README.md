The plugin converts images (JPG/PNG) to WebP in real-time during the upload process. This prevents your server from being clogged by multi-megabyte files and significantly improves loading speeds.

Key Features & Control Panel Options:

✅ Enable/Disable conversion with a single toggle.
✅ Keep or Replace Original: Choose to permanently delete the source JPG/PNG and keep only the optimized WebP in your Media Library. 
✅ WebP Quality Control: Fine-tune the compression level. 
✅ Max Width Limit: Automatically resize oversized images (e.g., downscaling a 5000px photo to 1920px).

Why use it?

📧 Emails & Media: It works for both images sent as email attachments and those saved to your WordPress Media Library. 🔄 Visual Loader: Provides immediate feedback! A loader is displayed during conversion so users know their files are being processed. 🖼 Single & Multiple Uploads: Fully supports multi-file upload fields.

⚠️ Technical Note: Designed specifically for the standard "File Upload" field. (Not compatible with "Drag & Drop" addon at this time).
