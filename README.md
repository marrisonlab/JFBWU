JetFormBuilder WebP Upload PRO
Real-time Image Optimization for JetFormBuilder Forms.

Stop letting unoptimized, massive images clog your server. JetFormBuilder WebP Upload PRO automatically intercepts image uploads from your forms and converts them to the modern WebP format instantly. This ensures faster loading speeds, reduced disk space usage, and a better user experience.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time Conversion: Converts JPG and PNG files to WebP during the upload process.

Media Library Integration: Choose whether to keep the original file or replace it entirely with the optimized WebP version.

Quality Control: Fine-tune the WebP compression level directly from the settings panel to balance quality and file size.

Automatic Resizing: Set a Maximum Width limit (e.g., 1920px) to prevent oversized photos (like 5000px+ raw uploads) from ever hitting your storage.

Visual Feedback: Displays a native loader during the conversion process, ensuring users know their files are being processed.

Email & Media Support: Works seamlessly for images sent as email attachments and those saved to the WordPress Media Library.

Bulk Support: Fully compatible with both single and multiple file upload fields.

🛠 Technical Specifications
Engine: Powered by server-side libraries (ImageMagick or GD Library) for high-performance processing.

Compatibility: Designed for the standard JetFormBuilder "File Upload" field.

Note: Currently not compatible with the "Drag & Drop" addon.
